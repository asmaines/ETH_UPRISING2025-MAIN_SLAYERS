The MilestoneFunding smart contract is a blockchain-based funding mechanism that keeps capital in check and distributes funds to a company in a systematic and responsible way. It facilitates milestone-based and transparent financing where investors offer funding to finance a company, and the funds are released incrementally as pre-defined milestones are met.

There are three primary positions at the center of the agreement:

- the company, who is the beneficiary of the funds

- the financial advisor, who oversees the release of funds and milestone approvals

- the investors, who invest capital to finance the project.

The agreement specifies a total amount of funding, which is to be raised within a specified funding time period for the project to proceed. If the target is met, the funds are locked in the contract and disbursed step by step as milestones are completed and signed off.

The funding process follows a systematic method:

- Investment Phase – Funds are invested into the contract by investors, which is tracked to ensure transparency and proper allocation.

- Milestone Approval – The financial advisor will ensure and approve each milestone. Only after approval will the corresponding percentage of funds be paid to the business.

- Plea System for Disputes – In case a milestone is in dispute, a plea can be submitted and considered before payment of the funds.

- Distribution of Funds – If all the milestones are met, the total funds will be fully disbursed to the company. *However, in case the target amount is not collected within the stipulated time, investors are eligible for refunds.*

This contract provides a transparent, secure, and decentralized financing option that controls lump sum risks. With its application of milestone funding and third-party vetoes, it ensures investor confidence and ensures appropriate use of funds in a bid to achieve the project goal.
